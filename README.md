# Memory-Card
This is an interactive web application built using Angular, featuring a dynamic scoreboard and a card shuffle game. The app fetches images and text from an external API and displays them as clickable cards. Users can shuffle the cards, and their scores are tracked, with the highest score saved as the "Best Score."
